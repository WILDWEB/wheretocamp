## Interactive Front-end Project

This Page was built to help people find places to camp all over europe.  It uses the search function to select the country or area location and then you use the submit button which drops the markers at the designated camping spots within a 10000 meter radius of the location center point.  
Once you click on a particular marker an info box pops up with the campsite information with a streetview button so you can go straight to the campsite and see what its like in street view.
